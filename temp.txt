Consider the situation of someone who needs to monitor their blood pressure and heart rate data.
Make a simple, attractive, intuitive, Android mobile app to track this data. Let us call this app:
CardiacRecorder.
Specifically, each measurement has the following fields:
• date measured (presented in dd-mm-yyyy format)
• time measured (presented in hh:mm format)
• systolic pressure in mm Hg (non-negative integer)
• diastolic pressure in mm Hg (non-negative integer)
• heart rate in beats per minute (non-negative integer)
• comment (textual, up to 20 characters)
Only the comment field may be left blank for a measurement.
The app should allow the user to:
• show a list of measurements
• add a new measurement (which always appends to the bottom end of the list)
• view and edit the details of an existing measurement
• delete a measurement
• see unusual blood pressures highlighted or flagged.
Normal pressures are systolic between 90 and 140 and diastolic between 60 and 90.
